# 1. Define where tests are located
testpaths = tests

# 2. Configure discovery (defaults are usually fine, but being explicit helps)

# 3. Register your custom markers to avoid "PytestUnknownMarkWarning"
markers =
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (slower, requires API keys)
    asyncio: mark a test as a coroutine

# 4. Asyncio configuration
# This allows you to write "async def test_..." without needing 
# @pytest.mark.asyncio on every single function.

# 5. Output settings
# -v: verbose (shows each test name)
# -ra: show extra summary info for (r)easons of failures/skips (a)ll
